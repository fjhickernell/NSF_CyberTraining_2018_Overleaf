abstract = {NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE. NAMD is distributed free of charge with source code at www.ks.uiuc.edu.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. According to implicit ligand theory, the standard binding free energy is an exponential average of the binding potential of mean force (BPMF), an exponential average of the interaction energy between the unbound ligand ensemble and a rigid receptor. Here, we use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to efficiently evaluate BPMFs by calculating interaction energies when rigid ligand configurations from the unbound ensemble are discretely translated across rigid receptor conformations. Results for standard binding free energies between T4 lysozyme and 141 small organic molecules are in good agreement with previous alchemical calculations based on (1) a flexible complex ( R≈0.9 for 24 systems) and (2) flexible ligand with multiple rigid receptor configurations ( R≈0.8 for 141 systems). While the FFT is routinely used for molecular docking, to our knowledge this is the first time that the algorithm has been used for rigorous binding free energy calculations.},

abstract = {The sodium-dependent NADH dehydrogenase (Na+-NQR) is a key component of the respiratory chain of diverse prokaryotic species, including pathogenic bacteria. Na+-NQR uses the energy released by electron transfer between NADH and ubiquinone (UQ) to pump sodium, producing a gradient that sustains many essential homeostatic processes, as well as virulence factor secretion, and the elimination of drugs. The location of the UQ binding site has been controversial, with two main hypotheses that suggest that this site could be located in the cytosolic subunit A or in the membrane-bound subunit B. In this work, we performed Alanine scanning mutagenesis of aromatic residues located in transmembrane helices II, IV and V of subunit B, near glycine residues 140 and 141. These two critical glycine residues form part of the structures that regulate the site accessibility. Our results indicate that the elimination of phenylalanine residues 211 or 213 abolishes the UQ-dependent activity, produces a leak of electrons to oxygen, and completely blocks the binding of UQ and the inhibitor HQNO. Molecular docking calculations predict that UQ interacts with phenylalanine 211 and pinpoints the location of the binding site in the interface of subunits B and D. The mutagenesis and structural analysis allow us to propose a novel UQ-binding motif, which is completely different compared to the sites of other respiratory photosynthetic complexes. These results are essential to understanding the electron transfer pathways and mechanism of Na+-NQR catalysis.},

Challenges in collecting large data sets motivate the pursuit of efficient statistical estimators that maximize use of available information. Along these lines, Hummer and Szabo developed an estimator that combines data from multiple time slices along a driven nonequilibrium process to compute the potential of mean force. Here, we generalize their approach, pooling information from multiple time slices to estimate arbitrary equilibrium expectations. Our expression may be combined with estimators of path-ensemble averages, including existing optimal estimators that use data collected by unidirectional and bidirectional protocols. We demonstrate the estimator by calculating free energies, moments of the polymer extension, the thermodynamic metric tensor, and the thermodynamic length in a model single-molecule pulling experiment. Compared to estimators that only use individual time slices, our multiple time-slice estimators yield substantially smoother estimates and achieve lower variance for higher-order moments. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

While many statistical estimators may be derived from these identities, some are more efficient than others. It has recently been suggested that trajectories sampled using a particular time-dependent protocol for perturbing the Hamiltonian may be analyzed with another one. Choosing an analysis protocol based on the nonequilibrium density was empirically demonstrated to reduce the variance and bias of free energy estimates. Here, we present an alternate mathematical formalism for protocol postprocessing based on the Feynmac-Kac theorem. The estimator that results from this formalism is demonstrated on a few low-dimensional model systems.

The characteristics of the ensemble express themselves in X-ray solution scattering data in predictable ways. Here we present an overview of the effect that structural diversity intrinsic to protein ensembles has on scattering data. We then demonstrate the observation of these effects in scattering from four molecular systems; myoglobin; ubiquitin; alcohol dehydrogenase; and HIV protease; and demonstrate the modulation of these ensembles by ligand binding, mutation, and environmental factors. The observations are analyzed quantitatively in terms of the average spatial extent of structural fluctuations occurring within these proteins under different experimental conditions. The insights which these analyses support are discussed in terms of the function of the various proteins. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 95: 531-542, 2011.},

In particular, we develop asymptotic variance estimates pertaining to Jarzynski's equality for free energies and the Hummer-Szabo expressions for the potential of mean force, calculated from uni- or bidirectional path samples. These estimators are demonstrated on a model single-molecule pulling experiment. In these simulations, the asymptotic variance expression is found to accurately characterize the confidence intervals around estimators when the bias is small. Hence, the confidence intervals are inaccurately described for unidirectional estimates with large bias, but for this model it largely reflects the true error in a bidirectional estimator derived by Minh and Adib.

abstract = {When a system is driven out of equilibrium by a time-dependent protocol that modifies the Hamiltonian, it follows a nonequilibrium path. Samples of these paths can be used in nonequilibrium work theorems to estimate equilibrium quantities such as free energy differences. Here, we consider analyzing paths generated with one protocol using another one. It is posited that analysis protocols which minimize the lag, the difference between the nonequilibrium and the instantaneous equilibrium densities, will reduce the dissipation of reprocessed trajectories and lead to better free energy estimates. Indeed, when minimal lag analysis protocols based on exactly soluble propagators or relative entropies are applied to several test cases, substantial gains in the accuracy and precision of estimated free energy differences are observed.},

abstract = {The nonequilibrium work relation allows for the calculation of equilibrium free energy differences between states based on the exponential average of accumulated work from irreversible transitions. Here, we compare two distinct approaches of calculating free energy surfaces from unidirectional single-molecule pulling experiments: the stiff spring approximation and the Hummer-Szabo method. First, we perform steered molecular dynamics simulations to mechanically stretch the model peptide deca-alanine using harmonic potentials with different spring stiffnesses and at various constant pulling velocities. We then calculate free energy surfaces based on the two methods and their variants, including the first and second cumulant expansion of the exponentially weighted work and the Gaussian position approximation for the delta function in Hummer and Szabo's expression. We find that with large harmonic force constants, the second cumulant expansion performs well in conjunction with either the stiff spring approximation or the Hummer-Szabo method. When interpreting dynamic force spectroscopy (pullings at different speeds), the second cumulant expansion of the stiff spring approximation performs the best when pulling velocities are similar, but variants of the Hummer-Szabo perform the best when they are spread over a large spectrum. While these conclusion are not definitive for all systems, the insights should prove useful for scientists interpreting nonequilibrium pulling experiments.},

@article{Makowski2008,
abstract = {In aqueous solution some proteins undergo large-scale movements of secondary structures, subunits or domains, referred to as protein "breathing", that define a native-state ensemble of structures. These fluctuations are sensitive to the nature and concentration of solutes and other proteins and are thereby expected to be different in the crowded interior of a cell than in dilute solution. Here we use a combination of wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and computational modeling to derive a quantitative measure of the spatial scale of conformational fluctuations in a protein solution. Concentration-dependent changes in the observed scattering intensities are consistent with a model of structural fluctuations in which secondary structures undergo rigid-body motions relative to one another. This motion increases with decreasing protein concentration or increasing temperature. Analysis of a set of five structurally and functionally diverse proteins reveals a diversity of kinetic behaviors. Proteins with multiple disulfide bonds exhibit little or no increase in breathing in dilute solutions. The spatial extent of structural fluctuations appears highly dependent on both protein structure and concentration and is universally suppressed at very high protein concentrations.

abstract = {External biasing forces are often applied to enhance sampling in regions of phase space which would otherwise be rarely observed. While the typical goal of these experiments is to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) along the biasing coordinate, here I present a method to construct PMFs in multiple dimensions and along arbitary alternative degrees of freedom. A protocol for multidimensional PMF reconstruction from nonequilibrium single-molecule pulling experiments is introduced and tested on a series of two-dimensional potential surfaces with varying levels of correlation. Reconstruction accuracy and convergence from several methods--this new protocol, equilibrium umbrella sampling, and free diffusion--are compared, and nonequilibrium pulling is found to be the most efficient. To facilitate the use of this method, the source code for this analysis is made freely available.},

abstract = {Due to their importance in molecular recognition, association free energy calculations have been the subject of many theoretical studies. In addition to enthalpic changes, the noncovalent binding of molecules is accompanied by a significant change in translational, rotational, vibrational, and solvent entropy. While enthalpic contributions to the free-energy can be accurately estimated using molecular force fields, entropic contributions to the free energy of binding are difficult to estimate because they require extensive sampling of phase space. In this study, we have calculated the entropie changes on binding of Fasciculin-2 to Acetylcholinesterase. In particular, by comparison with the Gibbs entropy formula, we have investigated the accuracy of the commonly invoked quasiharmonic approximation (QHA), and its sensitivity to the choice of reference structure used to eliminate translational and rotational motion. We propose a multiple-population decomposition of the simulation trajectory based on a principal component analysis(PCA) of the covariance matrix. By successively applying the original quasi-harmonic method to the separate populations, we can better satisfy the conditions necessary for QHA. Additionally, PCA provides a greater degree of physical insight into the entropic changes and their relationship to molecular structure and motion.},
