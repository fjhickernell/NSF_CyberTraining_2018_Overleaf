\section{Introduction}
Computational science draws upon the strengths of several disciplines, including computer science, mathematical science, and natural science.  Realizing the full potential of computational science for discovery requires multidisciplinary teams whose members can take full advantage of advanced hardware architectures and software environments.  Computational scientists require

\begin{itemize}
\item Depth within their chosen disciplines plus breadth across relevant disciplines, overcoming a silo mentality, and
\item Experience with advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI), including the practices that extend beyond what is required for computation on a single CPU.
\end{itemize}

The newly established Center for Interdisciplinary Scientific Computation (CISC) \url{http://cos.iit.edu/cisc} at Illinois Institute of Technology will lead the development of a new program to educate computational scientists that have the above attributes.  We will educate high school through doctoral students.  Learning will be curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular.  We will partner with nearby national laboratories, companies engaged in advanced computing, and schools whose students have less access to research experience and high-end computing facilities.

\subsection*{The Challenges}
Computing solutions to complex scientific problems requires well-educated computational scientists.  Successful attempts to train computational scientists must overcome two kinds of challenges.

\subsubsection*{Academic Silos.} Computational science draws on multiple disciplines, including computer science, mathematical science, and natural sciences.  Students must gain a deep understanding of their chosen discipline:

\begin{itemize}
\item Computer scientists must understand how emerging languages and architectures enable faster and more scalable computation.  

\item Computational mathematicians must be able to describe and analyze truncation and round-off errors in numerical algorithms and measurement and misspecification errors of statistical models.  They must know how to choose the most efficient algorithms for different kinds of problems.

\item Computational biologists, chemists, and physicists must grasp the important scientific ideas that need to be captured by computations.  They must understand the benefits and limitations of using computer modeling in their respective disciplines.

\end{itemize}
But this is not enough!  To be effective members of interdisciplinary teams tackling large, complex computational science problems, computational scientists must be exit their silos and become conversant in other disciplines.

\subsubsection*{Ignorance of Good Practice for Large Scale Computation.}  Solving large, complex computational problems using advanced CI deviates in important ways from what students typically learn in their coursework. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Effective algorithms that take advantage of muti-core, distributed memory architectures may be substantially different than algorithms designed for single CPUs.

\item The software required to solve large problems is often drawn from multiple sources, written in several languages, and developed over the course of years.

\item Those who perform computational experiments to solve scientific problems or demonstrate the performance of their new algorithms must ensure that their results can be reproduced by others who come after them \cite{Pen11}.  

\item Software contributors must ensure that their software is robust, interacts well with other software, and can be extended by those who come afterwards.  See \cite{BSS18} for a recent effort to promote these principles broadly.

\end{itemize}

We propose to to overcome these challenges in educating the next generation of computational scientists.

\subsection*{Why CISC Is Poised to Lead This}
CISC was created in May 2017 to leverage Illinois Tech’s existing strengths in computational science for greater impact.  CISC has been given office space, a modest budget, a 256-core cluster, and the good will of supporters among faculty and administrators.  Since its inception, CISC has initiated a series of lunchtime matchmaking seminars, brought its cluster online, hosted special lectures, and sponsored a seed grant competition. Fred J. Hickernell, PI and CISC’s director, is one of several computational mathematicians at Illinois Tech and previously served for twelve years as chair of the applied (and only) mathematics department.  Our computer science department has a historically strong group in high performance computing led by Xian-He Sun, a co-PI.  In recent years the biology, chemistry, and physics departments have hired computational scientists, including co-PIs David Minh (chemistry, CISC's associate director) and Jeff Wereszczynski (physics).  Co-PI Sou-Cheng Choi is a lead researcher at Allstate and a research associate professor in applied mathematics.

The (co-)PIs have experience developing curricula, mentoring high school students through PhD students, and partnering with College of DuPage, Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermilab.  Our proposed innovations will build upon our track record to build a strong multi-faceted training program for computational scientists.

\section{Results from Prior NSF Support} \FJHNote{Everyone needs to fill out their previous experience, need subsections on intellectual merit and broader impacts}
\subsection{Experience of Hickernell and Choi}
NSF-DMS-1522687\except{toc}{, \emph{Stable, Efficient, Adaptive Algorithms for Approximation and 
Integration}, \$270,000, August 2015 -- July 2018.} \label{SectHickernellPrevious}  Hickernell is PI and SCC is senior personnel.  

\subsubsection{Intellectual Merit}
One of the primary outcomes of this project related to the present proposal is the development of the Guaranteed Automatic Integration Library (GAIL) \cite{ChoEtal17b}.  This library comprises univariate and multivariate integration, univariate function approximation, and univariate optimization algorithms that automatically determine the sample size required to meet user-defined error tolerances.  The library does not rely on interval arithmetic, as is done in INTLAB \cite{MoKeCl09, Rum99a, Rum10a}, but like INTLAB, GAIL comes with theoretical guarantees that common adaptive algorithms lack. The recent GAIL developments include locally adaptive function approximation and optimization \cite{ChoEtal17a, Din15a}, adaptive quasi-Monte Carlo cubature \cite{HicJim16a, JimHic16a}, and the ability to set a hybrid error tolerance involving both absolute and relative error criteria \cite{HicEtal17a}.  Other Articles, theses,  software, and preprints supported in part by this grant include

\subsubsection{Broader Impacts}  Three students (two female) have completed their PhD degrees, and three PhD students are in the midst of their PhD degrees.  One PhD graduate spent time working at Fermilab as a student helping them implement modern Monte Carlo methods.  Another PhD student is picking up where the first one left off.  Two students (one female) completed their MS theses, and one female student has nearly completed her MS thesis. More than a dozen undergraduate students have been mentored (primarily during the summer),  over the course of three summers.  Hickernell has embedded the new adaptive (quasi-)Monte Carlo research in his yearly graduate Monte Carlo class, and some students in that class have contributed to GAIL.  Hickernell and SCC and their students have written an encyclopedia article, given numerous conference and colloquium talks, and organized a conference and special conference sessions at multiple conferences.  Hickernell has given an invited conference tutorial and is one of the program leaders for this year's SAMSI program on quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. Hickernell received the 2016 Joseph F.\ Traub Prize for Achievement in Information-Based Complexity.

\subsection{Skills to Be Learned}
Our primary emphasis is educating CI contributors (CICs), and our secondary emphasis is educating CI users (CIUs).  Our goal is to train students from high school through PhD level in skills of various difficulty, some building upon others.  These include the following.

\begin{longtable}
{r>{\raggedright}p{0.65\textwidth}ccc}

\end{longtable} 

What we mean by this table is that a future CIC should ideally develop in high school all of the skills labeled HS, during undergraduate studies  all of the skills labeled UG, and during graduate studies all the skills labeled G.  The analogous interpretation applies to CIUs.  Our proposed innovations, outlined in the next subsection, will provide opportunities to a future CICs and CIUs to develop these skills.  

The depth of any one of these skills may depend on whether the computational scientist is majoring in computer science, mathematical science, or natural science.  Moreover, our students have multiple entry and exit points in our program.  Some students that we serve may not have had the ideal preparation in their earlier studies and will require help to catch up.


%\subsection{Program Innovations}
Our innovations will better prepare CICs and CIUs via several modes of learning for different kinds of students.

\subsection{Summer camp for high school students} \label{Camp} For the past several years Illinois Tech's College of Science has run a three-week computational science summer camp for Chicago area high school students.  The goal has been to introduce them to solving mathematical and scientific problems using Mathematica.  The Admissions Office publicizes and recruits students for the camp.  Starting in the summer of 2018 this summer camp has an academic home in CISC, while continuing to partner with the Admissions Office.  Dr.\ Kiah Wah Ong is the instructor.

We will broaden this camp to include computing on the CISC cluster to introduce these high school students to multi-core computing (Skills \ref{OneCPU}--\ref{MultiJobs}).  Mathematica has the capability to perform computations in parallel, and we will also investigate the use of other languages.  This summer camp will encourage the students to pursue degrees involving high performance computation and better prepare them for potential careers as computational scientists.  We also hope to attract the students to Illinois Tech's computational science offerings.  

Because our students are expected to have diverse backgrounds in computing, we will begin the camp by assessing their existing skills and the break them into groups so that those who need to learn more fundamental skills may do so, while those with more advanced knowledge can be given more challenging assignments.  Illinois Tech students will serve as teaching assistants (TAs) for the camp, which will provide them with the opportunity to reinforce their own learning by teaching the computational science that they have learned. 

Our goal is to host 20 high school students in the summer of 2019 and increase the number each year to 40 high school students steady state in the summer of 2021.  The summer camp is funded by tuition fees.  In order to broader access, we plan to offer tuition scholarships to those with financial need.  Due to the planned expansion, some grant funding may be required to support the tuition expenses in the short term.

\subsection{Strengthening undergraduate and graduate level computational science coursework} \label{Curr} 
Illinois Tech already has a substantial computational science curriculum.  However, it has several deficiencies, which we aim to address.

\subsubsection{Increasing accessibility to existing computational science offerings} \label{CurrExist} Illinois Tech quite a few several computational courses.  Computer science offers high performance computing at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Applied mathematics BS through PhD students must all take at least one computational mathematics course and may choose from a handful of computational mathematics electives. There are two undergraduate computational physics courses, a computational chemistry course, and a computational biology course.

These courses teach Skills \ref{OneCPU}, \ref{EffOne}, and \ref{Natural}.  However, students tend to take only the courses in their own major.  Thus an applied mathematics student may not really have the chance to develop Skill \ref{Natural}.  The (co-)PIs, who teach some of these courses, will liaise  with other course instructors and the host departments to encourage non-majors to take these courses (Skill \ref{Other}).  This includes publicizing the relevant courses and exploring how we might lower the pre-requisite barriers.

\subsubsection{Professional Practices for Computational Science} \label{RelSoft} In the Fall 2013 Choi and Hickernell piloted a one-credit course on Reliable Mathematical Software, primarily for their own graduate students.  The course covered truncation and round-off errors,
stopping criteria for adaptive software,
creating software collaboratively via Git, 
documentation,
input parsing and validation, and
reproducible computation.
Students completed a project consisting of a small software library or an extension to an existing library.  Several of the students in this course participated in developing GAIL) \cite{ChoEtal17b}.  This experience helped one student land an academic job teaching computer science, three students land computationally oriented positions in industry, and a fifth student gain admission to a PhD program.

In this project we will grow this to a standard three-credit undergraduate/graduate elective course.  In addition to a fuller treatment of the above topics, which address Skills \ref{Repro}--\ref{ContLib}, we will add material on working in a multi-lingual environment (Skill \ref{MultiLing}) and small-scale parallel computation (Skills \ref{TwoCPU} and \ref{MultiJobs}).  The prerequisite will be any undergraduate course that covers numerical computation.

\subsubsection{Large-Scale Scientific Computation} \label{LargeSC} Since 2006 the computer science department has offered a graduate course, Advanced Scientific Computation, which covers Skills \ref{Tight}, \ref{AnalVis}, \ref{MultiLing}, \ref{HighLib}, and \ref{EffLarge}.  Dr.\ Hong Zhang from Argonne National Laboratory has taught this course to students in computer science, mathematics, physics, and engineering. Students were exposed to cutting-edge analytic and algorithmic research projects and gained hands-on large-scale numerical programming experience. This course has been a launching point for many students into careers in computational science.  Several of the course projects were integrated into the Portable Extensible Toolobox for Scientific Computing (PETSc) \cite{petsc-web-page17} [PETS13], benefiting the scientific community in large. At least eight students received summer internships at Argonne after taking her course, and three of her students eventually became post-doctoral researchers at Argonne.  

In the past, this course has run only every other year.  We plan to increase the frequency of this course to annually, serving a dozen or more students, by advertising its existence and benefits.  Students taking this course will be more competitive for the other opportunities below.

\subsubsection{} A new computational physics/chemistry/biology course using OpenScience Grid and XSEDE? \FJHNote{David and Jeff, something here for you?}

\subsection{Research experiences for under-served undergraduates} 
Community colleges enroll approximately 45\% of the nation's undergraduate students, a disproportionate number of which are underrepresented minorities \cite{KnappKG12,nsfreport13}.  Nearly 90\% of these students have a goal of transferring to four-year institutions to complete their bachelor's degree, however the actual transfer rate is estimated to be only 25-40\% \cite{HoachlanderSH03,MelguizoKA11}.  Studies have shown that involving students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in  research activities decreases  their attrition rate and increases the probability they will pursue further education \cite{BarlowV04,JonesBV10}.

To  encourage the pursuit of bachelor's and advanced degrees by community college students, \JW has partnered in the past with the College of DuPage (COD) to recruit students from their associate degree programs  to engage in a ten-week summer internship program in his research group.  We propose to broaden this program to include several CISC associated research groups at Illinois Tech. Each year we will work with Prof.~Tom Carter of the physics department to advertise and recruit students to this program,  with a particular focus on underrepresented minorities.  These students will be matched with CISC labs based on their research interests and career goals.  Our goal is to aim for 

In the first phase of their internships, the cohort of COD students will spend a week in an intensive computing ``crash course'' that will include topics such as an introduction to linux, programming in python, and the use of high performance computing resources.  For the remaining nine weeks, CoD students will work directly in IIT labs on various computational projects, such as high performance Monte Carlo methods in Choi's and Hickernell's group, ??? in the Minh's group, ??? in Sun's group \JWNote{help me list a few}, and simulations of biomolecular complexes in the Wereszczynski group.  To foster discussions among the CoD students, weekly lunches will be organized.  In addition, at the end of the summer a research symposium will be organized in which students will present a short presentation on their work.  Following the summer period, we will track the career trajectories of these students with annual follow up surveys, and we will maintain mentoring relationship with these students as are appropriate. 

We will aim for four COD students in 2019, six in 2020, and six in 2021.  Students will be provided \$5000 stipends.  After the project ends, we hope to secure funding to continue from other sources, such as Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) funding and REU add-on supplemental funding.


\subsection{CISC Summer Fellowships} \label{Fellow}
To provide more opportunities for the practice of the advanced CI skills that we are teaching our students, we plan to offer summer fellowships to Illinois Tech undergraduate and graduate students.  These will be awarded on a competitive basis and be provided to students who partake one of the following experiences
\begin{itemize}
\item Embedding themselves in a computational science research group outside their major, or
\item Joining a large-scale computational science research project at Argonne or Fermilab.
\end{itemize}

The former opportunity will help obtain our goal of getting students outside their silos.  The broadening experience will make them more valuable members of interdisciplinary teams performing large-scale computations.  It will help them learn and practice Skills \ref{Natural}, \ref{Other}.

The ongoing large-scale computational projects at Argonne and Fermilab will provide students the opportunity to learn and practice Skills .  Argonne has several software development projects including the Portable Extensible Toolobox for Scientific Computing (PETSc) \cite{petsc-web-page17} and xSDK

Each year, starting in 2019, we will offer CISC fellowships to two undergraduates (\$5000 stipend each) and five graduate students (\$7000 stipend each).  The students will apply in the early part of the year, providing a synopsis of their proposed projects, their curriculum vitae, and letters of recommendation from their advisors and the project supervisors.
